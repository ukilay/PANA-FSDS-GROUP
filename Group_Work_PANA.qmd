## Brief Group Reflection

| What Went Well | What Was Challenging |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| A              | The acquisition of historical open-source data is restricted. It can only be obtained through "Index of /~jreades/data". Although it is sufficient, the snapshots are not taken at the same fixed time each year.                    |

## Priorities for Feedback

Are there any areas on which you would appreciate more detailed feedback if we're able to offer it?

# Response to Questions

See the raw file for examples of how to hide computational output as there is code hidden here.

```{python}
#| echo: False
import os
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
#| echo: False
host = 'https://orca.casa.ucl.ac.uk'
path = '~jreades/data'
file = '20240614-London-listings.parquet'

if os.path.exists(file):
  df = pd.read_parquet(file)
else: 
  df = pd.read_parquet(f'{host}/{path}/{file}')
  df.to_parquet(file)
```

## 1. Who collected the InsideAirbnb data?

::: {.duedate}

( 2 points; Answer due Week 7 )

:::

An inline citation example: As discussed on @insideairbnb, there are many...

A parenthetical citation example: There are many ways to research Airbnb [see, for example, @insideairbnb]... 

## 2. Why did they collect the InsideAirbnb data?

::: {.duedate}

( 4 points; Answer due Week 7 )

:::

```{python}
#| output: asis
print(f"One of way to embed output in the text looks like this: after cleaning, we were left with {df.shape[0]:,} rows of data.")
```

This way is also supposed to work (`{python} f"{df.shape[0]:,}" `) but I've found it less reliable.

```{python}
ax = df.host_listings_count.plot.hist(bins=50);
ax.set_xlim([0,500]);
```

## 3. How was the InsideAirbnb data collected?  
The InsideAirbnb data was collected using automated web scraping, a method where scripts extract information from Airbnb's website by parsing its HTML content. Collaborator Michael "Ziggy" Mintz automated the scraping process (InsideAirbnb website), while Murray Cox compiled, analysed, and built the platform. Python scripts were used to collect snapshots of public data via the Airbnb website periodically, replacing older data for each location (Alsudais 2021). In the first stage, they browsed the Airbnb website to look for All listings within a city. If any listing was not visible. Then, in the second stage, the program would visit the page of each listing to collect the detailed information of that listing (Cox and Slee, 2016).

## 4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness and/or accuracy of the InsideAirbnb data set's representation of the process it seeks to study, and what wider issues does this raise?

::: {.duedate}

( 11 points; Answer due Week 9 )

:::

## 5. What ethical considerations does the use of the InsideAirbnb data raise? 

::: {.duedate}

( 18 points; Answer due {{< var assess.group-date >}} )

:::

## 6. With reference to the InsideAirbnb data (*i.e.* using numbers, figures, maps, and descriptive statistics), what does an analysis of Hosts and Listing types suggest about the nature of Airbnb lets in London? 

::: {.duedate}

( 15 points; Answer due {{< var assess.group-date >}} )

:::

## 7. Drawing on your previous answers, and supporting your response with evidence (*e.g.* figures, maps, EDA/ESDA, and simple statistical analysis/models drawing on experience from, e.g., CASA0007), how *could* the InsideAirbnb data set be used to inform the regulation of Short-Term Lets (STL) in London?

## Sustainable Authorship Tools

Using the Terminal in Docker, you compile the Quarto report using `quarto render <group_submission_file>.qmd`.

Your QMD file should automatically download your BibTeX and CLS files and any other required files. If this is done right after library loading then the entire report should output successfully.

Written in Markdown and generated from [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Fonts used: [Spectral](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral) (mainfont), [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) (<span style="font-family:Sans-Serif;">sansfont</span>) and [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains%20Mono) (`monofont`).
